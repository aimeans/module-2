# Project Title

Loan qualifier app. The loan qualifier app is a program designed to stream line qualifying for a home lone in order to see what banks are willing to loan money based on your credit score, debt to income ratio, loan to value ratio, and max loan size a bank is willing to offer.
If any banks are willing to loan based on your criteria it will ask if youd like to save those banks to a csv file for future use.
